To run the program, first add the ids to the dataset as follows (already added, so you can skip this step):

```python add_ids.py``` -> on windows

```python3 add_ids.py``` -> on windows

then, run the database using json server as follows:

```npx json-server --watch .\dataset-extra1.json``` -> on windows

```json-server --watch .\dataset-extra1.json``` -> on linux

and then use nodejs as follows:

```nodejs server.js```
